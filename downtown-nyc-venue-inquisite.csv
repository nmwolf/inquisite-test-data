New sounds like acid rock and LaMonte Young's aggressively dissonant Theater of Eternal Music were part of the neighborhood soundtrack. Pop-artist Andy Warhol rented the Polish National Social Hall at 23 St. Mark's Place and transformed it into the Electric Circus.

Downtown Beirut,,158 First Avenue,,,,,,,"â€œIn the â€™80s I felt that every block on the Lower East Side had the potential to change my life. After all, there was Allen Ginsberg heading home to East 12th Street with a bag of groceries; Joey and Marky Ramone, in black leather jackets, striding down St. Markâ€™s Place like kings; Thurston Moore and Kim Gordon flipping through art magazines at Gem Spa. Every day new art galleries were literally bursting out of holes in the wall. Keith Haring was alive, Jeff Koons was revving up his shell game, and Julian Schnabel was smashing plates. The streets were alive with the sound of punk and hip-hop, every wall tagged in graffiti, the sidewalks glittering with crack vials. Tompkins Square Park had become the squalid Tent City and the scene of a riot. Half the tenement buildings on the Lower East Side looked burned out, and seemingly held together only by the CBGB Sunday matinee posters plastered to the bricks. Downtown Beirut flaunted a similarly appealing squalidness. . . . The bathroom was plastered in band stickers, the walls magic-markered with proclamations of love and hate, philosophical rantings and explicit hieroglyphics depicting human genitalia. . . . There was a kind of anonymity that came when I slipped into the low light and smoke, my voice distorted by the pounding jukebox. I wasnâ€™t the girl from a small town in Delaware . . . whose first job in the city was selling diamond earrings at Tiffanyâ€™s. I was a writer. I was the girl with the white buzz cut, in a black leather jacket and Doc Martens Iâ€™d bought from Jimmy at Trash and Vaudeville, with the last of my paycheck. . . . The jukebox could be . . . like a fearsome mythological beast hunkered down, blasting punk and hardcore: Throbbing Gristle, Dead Kennedys, the Misfits.

The Drawing Center,,137 Greene Street,,,1977,late 1980s,,,"""â€œ[Martha] Beckâ€™s little museum was established in 1977 and originally housed in $900-a-month ground-floor space in a warehouse at 137 Greene Street in SoHo. (It moved to its present location, at 35 Wooster Street, in the late 1980s.) Its mission was to rectify what Ms. Beck saw as museumsâ€™ longstanding neglect of drawings. If paintings and sculptures represented the grand narratives of fine art, she said, drawings were often the original flashes of insight that led to them â€” the â€˜intimate, direct and experimental state of an artistâ€™s creative process,â€™ as she put it. . . . A former assistant curator of drawings at the Museum of Modern Art, Ms. Beck became a phenomenon in the SoHo art scene of the 1970s and â€™80s for her ability to put together shows of major-museum quality on a budget based on modest grants from the New York State Council on the Arts, the National Endowment for the Arts and private donors. . . . The Drawing Center has since expanded its mission to include other art forms, including dance and multimedia animation.â€ù Vitello2014","Vitello, Paul. â€œMartha Beck, Who Founded the Drawing Center in New York, Dies at 75.â€ù New York Times (January 22, 2014).",TB,

In 1956 an all-star sextet, including Phil Woods, Duke Jordan, Art Taylor, and Cecil Payne, recorded a tribute to Charlie Parker at the club (released on the Signal label). Landmarks in the Five Spotâ€™s history were the long residencies held from 1956 by Cecil Taylor and in 1957â€“9 by Thelonious Monk as the leader of a quartet of changing personnel, involving, most notably, John Coltrane (1957). Ornette Coleman made his controversial New York dÃ©but there and held a series of residencies at the club between 1959 and 1961. In the latter year Eric Dolphy gave important performances that were recorded and issued as Live! at the Five Spot. Monk returned to the club in 1963 after it had moved to its new location on the West side. Another influential connection was that with Charles Mingus, who first appeared at the Five Spot in its early days and played for an extended period in 1964â€“5. In 1972 the clubâ€™s management took a new direction, opening premises on St. Marks Place under the name the Two Saints and presenting a repertory that emphasized jazz-rock. The original name was resumed, however, in 1975 and the Five Spot reopened with Art Blakeyâ€™s Jazz Messengers. Among others who performed there were Coleman (1975) and Jackie McLean.

[a new name for a neighborhood] traditionally . . . considered part of the immigrant Lower East Side. (Andy Warhol called it 'Babushkaville.'). These buildings were home to three related, and overlapping music scenes: the Dom, the Electric Circus, and Warhol's Exploding Plastic Inevitable. In the 1880s, they had housed the German social organization called Arlington Hall; in the 1920s, the hall was bought by the Polish National Home as a public gathering space, bar, and restaurant. Then, in the 1960s, the bar was taken over by Stanley Tolkin, and the upstairs ballroom became a club called the Dom [taken from Polski Dom Narodwy (Polish National Home)] . . . known for its good jukebox and racially integrated crowd. Meanwhile, Stanley's Bar, downstairs, played host to bands like the Fugs. . . . In April 1966, Andy Warhol rented the building and completely restyled its interior. He installed a rotating, mirrored ball, resuscitating the long-dormant dance floor accessory that later would come to define the age of disco. When he was done . . . a month-long party began that he dubbed the Exploding Plastic Inevitable . . . [whose house band was the Velvet Underground]. Warhol soon took the party on the road. . . . When they returned to New York [in 1966], the Dom had become the Balloon Farm, which was soon transformed [in 1967] into the Electric Circus. . .
